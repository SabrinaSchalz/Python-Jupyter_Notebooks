# Python-Portfolio

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks I wrote for fun side projects, mainly based on Kaggle datasets.

The Titanic notebook contains a decision tree model to solve the classic Kaggle Titanic challenge. I had previously done this challenge in R, so the data exploration was largely skipped in this notebook. You can find a write-up of my approach on my blog: sabrinaschalz.wordpress.com/2022/12/09/the-titanic-kaggle-competition/

Sales Predictions September Competition was part of a Kaggle competition with made-up book sales data. The challenge was to predict sales for 2021. I did both the data exploration and the modelling (linear regression, decision tree, random forest) for this in Python, and posted a summary of my approach on my blog: sabrinaschalz.wordpress.com/2022/12/10/sales-predictions-kaggle-competition-september-2022/

I solved the Spaceship Titanic competition with a logistic regression. You can find the write-up here: sabrinaschalz.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-competition/
